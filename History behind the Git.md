   <h2>ðŸŽ‡Source Code Control System :</h2>
     <p>Source Code Control System (SCCS) is a version control system designed to track changes in source code and other text files during the development of a piece of software. This allows the user to retrieve any of the previous versions of the original source code and the changes which are stored.</p>
     <h3>Disadvantages : </h3>
      <li>Source code takes up too much space because it is repeated in every version.</li>
      <li>It is hard to acquire information about when and where changes occurred.</li>
      <li>It is closed source.</li>
  <br>
     <em><b>Note</b> : <b><code>Closed source</code></b> software is software that holds the source code safe and encrypted. Meaning, the user canâ€™t copy, modify, or delete parts of the code without some type of consequence. It can go from voiding the warranty to even legal repercussions.
     <b><code>Open source</code></b> software is software that does the complete opposite. It allows users to copy, modify, or delete parts of the code under their own discretion. The user is able to use functions of the open source on their own program with no consequence.</em>
 
 <h2>ðŸŽ‡Revision Control System :</h2>
    <p>Revision control, also known as version control or source control, is the management of changes made over time. These changes can be to source code, project assets, or any other information that goes into the finished product. It permits many people to work on the same parts of a project without worrying that their changes will overwrite the work of anyone else.
    Its is <strong>open source</strong> and also Simple structure and easy to work with. </p>
    <h3>Disadvantages : </h3>
       <li>There is little security, in the sense that the version history can be edited by the users.</li>
        <li>Only one user can work on a file at a time.</li>
  
 <h2>ðŸŽ‡Concurrent Version System :</h2>
    <p>Concurrent Versions System (CVS) is a program that lets a code developer save and retrieve different development versions of source code. It also lets a team of developers share control of different versions of files in a common repository of files. This kind of program is sometimes known as a version control system .It is <b>open source</b> and Multiple user can work on a file at a time.</p>
    <h3>Disadvantages : </h3>
      <li>CVS changes are time consuming.</li>
      <li>CVS do not commit if there is error into the commit.</li>
      
 <h2>ðŸŽ‡Apache Subversion (SVN) :</h2>
      <p>Apache Subversion (SVN) is a free and <b>open-source</b> software developed by the Apache Software Foundation that acts as a control system for tracking changes to files, images, folders and directories. It is used to assist in recovering data and recording the history of changes made over time.</p>
      <h3>Disadvantages : </h3>
        <li>Does not have features such as pull requests, which is key for open source development.</li>
        <li>Can sometimes be slow, especially with large repositories.</li>
   
 <h2>ðŸŽ‡Bitkeeper supply chain management :</h2>
     <p>BitKeeper is a fast, enterprise-ready, distributed SCM that scales up to very large projects and down to tiny ones.It is not free to use.</p>
     <h3>Disadvantages : </h3>
       <li>It can only duplicate a repository and work against it, and cannot work against a working copy of a snapshot. This makes large checkouts over a WAN very slow.</li>
 <br>
      <em><b>Note :</b> A distributed version control system (DVCS) is a type of version control where the complete codebase â€” including its full version history â€” is mirrored on every developer's computer. It's abbreviated DVCS. Changes to files are tracked between computers.</em>
 
 <h2>ðŸŽ‡Git is Born :</h2>
    <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</p>
    <h3>Advantages : </h3>
      <li>Good distributed model as each developer gets a local repository with a full history of commits which makes git fast compared to other VCs.</li>
      <li>Branching capabilities and merging are easy (as they are cheap), good data integrity.</li>
      <li>They are free and open-source we can easily download the source code and performs changes to it. They can handle larger projects efficiently.</li>
      <li>The push/pull operations are faster with a simple They save time and developers can fetch and create pull requests without switching.</li>
  </p>
